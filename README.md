#My Memory Game Project

A browser based card matching style game with dynamic features and animations

## Game Rules 
Click on a card to flip it. Try and find its matching card. If there is no match, the card will flip back over. Match all the cards as fast as you can in a few moves as possible. 
The player starts with three stars, and consecutively loses them as they make moves. 


## Code Comments 
It was my first time using JavaScript,css and html together, so I struggled a little bit with the implementation. I used css to handle the flipping anitmation by implementing divs on top of each other and transforming their rotation property. I used a grid layout and populated it using the DOM and Javascript. Half way through the project I realized I wasn't using OOP methodology and had to completely refracture my code. 

## Assets
I made the spider image and stars using Adobe Illustrator. All the card images were downloaded for free from

## Why is the project submitted late
I was on track to submit this project on time, however, I got really sick with a Virus and Shingles. Because of this I was hospitalized and wasn't able to complete the project until I recovered.
